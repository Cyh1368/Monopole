Both the curvature of space and the dilation of time seem to simply be empirical facts of our existence, and together these phenomena have convinced physicists that we are, at the very least, living in a four-dimensional reality called Space-Time.\n",

Einstein’s theory goes on to correctly predict that these same distortions in space-time also bend light waves.\n",
