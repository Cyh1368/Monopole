\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe have two really fundamental answers to this question. Both stem from the standard model lagrangian\\\\n\\\\n[math]L = \\\\\\\\int d^4x \\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\sqrt{-g}}{4\\\\\\\\pi}\\\\\\\\left(R - 2\\\\\\\\Lambda + 4 \\\\\\\\pi \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\rm m} \\\\\\\\right).[/math]\\\\n\\\\nwith [math]\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\rm m}[/math] the matter lagrangian, containing terms defining everything we see, and other bits that describe gravity. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGravity is a force field just like electromagnetism\\\\n\\\\nThe first is that gravity is a massless, spin 2 boson which couples to everything for of matter (due to the presence of the metric determinant [math]\\\\\\\\sqrt{-g} = det|g_{\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\nu}|[/math] multiplying [math]\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\rm m}[/math]). In this interpretation, gravity is a particle--a force carrier that couples to every excitation of the underlying fields (e.g. every particle), which causes these particles to feel an (extremely weak) attractive force. In this interpretation, [math]R - 2 \\\\\\\\Lambda [/math] is the gravitational particle (the graviton) self-energy: it\\'s the gravitational equivalent of the electromagnetic field energy. This is the wave-particle interpretation--gravity is a (presumably quantized) field, virtual excitations of which mediate a gravitational force. Since the coupling happens at the level of full terms in the lagrangian density (which is a particle\\'s contribution to the energy density), the \\'charge\\' objects have under the gravitation force is equal to their energy--for slow-moving particles we encounter every day, that\\'s equivalent to their mass. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGravity is spacetime curvature\\\\n\\\\nThe second is that gravity is a consequence of trying to make physics coordinate independent. Here, the [math]\\\\\\\\sqrt{-g}[/math] is in the Lagrangian centrally so that a chance of coordinates doesn\\'t affect the region under which the integral is performed--it\\'s the Jacobian of a general coordinate transformation. But this introduces a problem, because now (if we left out the [math]R - 2 \\\\\\\\Lambda[/math]) the value of the integral changes under variation of the coordinates: in other words, [math]\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\delta \\\\\\\\int d^4x \\\\\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\rm m}}{\\\\\\\\delta g_{\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\nu}} \\\\\\\\ne 0[/math]. This means that a change of coordinates affects the physics. We don\\'t want that, so we counterbalance this term: [math]\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\delta \\\\\\\\int d^4x \\\\\\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\\\\\rm m}}{\\\\\\\\delta g_{\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\nu}} = \\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\delta (R - 2 \\\\\\\\Lambda)}{\\\\\\\\delta g_{\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\nu}}[/math] with [math]R - 2\\\\\\\\Lambda[/math] now interpreted as an expression of the intrinsic curvature of spacetime (with [math]R[/math] the Ricci scalar the trace of the curvature tensor). This is a geometric interpretation--gravity is a consequence of diffeomorphism (coordinate change) invariance, which naturally leads to spacetime, in the presence of matter, having nontrivial intrinsic curvature. This curvature bends the straight, inertial path of particles, causing--not unlike snowballs rolling down hills and into valleys--those paths to veer towards regions of greater mass-energy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClassically, the two descriptions make exactly the same predictions and are totally equivalent, while quantum mechanically, neither make any sense (for different reasons).

In Newton\\'s Principia Mathematica his three Laws of Motion and his Law of Gravity are stated. But so is Newton\\'s bafflement over what gravity is. Even though he defined it mathematically so precisely, and note -- mathematically --, so it stood as humanity\\'s paradigm of gravity for 200 years, until Einstein, still Newton wonders, in The Principia, what gravity actually is. He famously states, paraphrased,\\\\n\\\\nAbout what gravity is, I frame no hypothesis...\\\\n\\\\nSo Newton was with you when you wondered just what gravity is. And even the great Newton had no clue, so to speak, what gravity is, and said so: good company indeed!\\\\n\\\\nBefore Einstein developed his theories of uniform motion, and then the more complicated equations of accelerated motion and of gravity, in his Special and General Relativity papers, Newton\\'s theories reigned as gospel for nearly 200 years. (Note: scientists rarely call any of their theories \\\\\"Laws\\\\\" or worse, \\\\\"Laws of Nature,\\\\\" anymore because nature is \\\\\"smarter\\\\\" than we are, than we can even imagine -- hence it is false to say a theory is a \\\\\"Law (of Nature).\\\\\" Every theory tends to be tweaked or even overturned by a more accurate one over time. This lesson, that scientific pronouncements, every single one ever discovered, has a \\\\\"shelf life,].\\\\\" Science had not learned this lesson when Newton wrote his astonishing Principia Mathematica, so this theories are \\\\\"Laws\\\\\" -- by convention at this point, because Newton\\'s theories were shown to be profoundly lacking, and were \\\\\"overturned\\\\\" by Einstein\\'s much deeper laws. \\\\n\\\\nAnd it is Einstein, in special relativity (1905, Annalen der Physik) and General Relativity especially (1915), that tells us what gravity actually is. \\\\n\\\\nThe theories of relativity tell us, logically and mathematically, what gravity is. They tell us that gravity is not a thing, but an effect. The way to think about gravity was stated succinctly by Wheeler (Feynman\\'s Ph.D advisor, and also the man who coined the terms \\\\\"black hole and multiverse):\\\\n\\\\nWheeler said\\\\\"\\\\nGravity tells matter how to move; matter tells gravity how to curve.\\\\n\\\\nMass, Einstein showed, warps spacetime. And spacetime, in its warping, tells matter how to move. The classic example is to think of what a trampoline looks like if you were to roll a bowling ball onto it. The ball would roll to the middle of the trampoline, and settle (create) a deep pit, or warping, of the fabric of the trampoline. If a marble were shot across the trampoline after the bowling ball settled in its pit, the marble would not travel in a straight line, but curve along with the curving of the trampoline surface. In this way, in our universe of three dimensions of space (think of a dimension as the freedom to move a certain way: up and down, back and forth, right and left, in our universe) and one dimension of time. \\\\n\\\\nOn a Neutron Star, where one teaspoonful of matter would weigh several tons!  time! is massively stretched and slowed down, and the Neutron Star warps space around it like the bowling ball. Our sun does the same, creating a topology in the fabric of spacetime such that the planet, in traveling in straight lines, are actually moving in a circle (as seen by an observer outside the plane of the ecliptic). But as far as the planet knows, it is just buzzing along in a straight line. \\\\n\\\\nThese predictions of special and general relativity have been tested for 100 years now, thousands of times, thousands of ways -- and Einstein\\'s Relativity has never be falsified, not once. Never. And scientists are forever (it seems) finding new effects (black holes, gravitational lensing) which pop out of Einstein\\'s theory. It speaks to those who profoundly understand it, telling them what is up nature\\'s sleeve, if you will.\\\\n\\\\nOne experiment was done as follows. An atomic clock (the most accurate kind of clocks we can make, they \\\\\"tick\\\\\" to the periodic and identical vibrations of Cesium atoms).... so an atomic clock was put on an airplane and flown to Washington, D.C., where another atomic clock was setup as a control. When the clock arrived in D.C., the two clocks were compared. They should have had the exact same time, pre-Einstein. But the fact was (is) that the clock from the airplane was slightly ahead of the one which stayed earthbound.\\\\n\\\\nOn an airplane the warping of spacetime is slightly less than on the ground of the Earth, relativity predicts correctly. In other words, gravity is a tiny bit less strong as one moves further away froam the planet\\'s surface. Again, this is predicted by General Relativity and occurs because, being 30,000 feet above the Earth\\'s surface and moving at 700 mph, an airplane (a modern passenger jet, say) experiences less slowing of time due to matter\\'s (the Earth, that is -- the whole thing) , since spacetime is less warped as one moves away from warping body; and thus gravity less strong, as well . Now the amount of difference is measured in nano - units. Fly 80 miles above the Earth, and one feels no \\\\\"weight\\\\\" at all, i.e., weightless. The International Space Station is far enough from the planet\\'s mass so that spacetime is not warped enough to effectively feel gravity, so astronauts have no weight. What is really happening is the ISS is in orbit around the planet and so constantly falling toward the planet (there is still some gravity if a body is orbiting the Earth), while the planet is constantly, equally falling away from the ISS as it falls.\\\\n\\\\nNotice, that I wrote \\\\\"one feels weightless.\\\\\" I am referring to what relativity whispers to us, by saying one feels weightless, not one is weightless, because I must defer to Einstein\\'s proof that acceleration and gravity are identical,  they are the same thing!  Einstein realiazed this when he had an epiphany while at work as a Swiss technical patent clerk second class and accidentally falling backward in his chair. He called the epiphany he had, that one does not \\\\\"feel\\\\\" one\\'s weight when in \\\\\"free fall,\\\\\" the \\\\\"happiest thought of his life.\\\\\" Now, Relativity has spoken to many scientists and mathematicians besides its creator-discoverer, i.e., Einstein himself.\", \"upvoteCount\": 73, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-is-gravity?top_ans=10182695\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 4, \"followerCount\": 0, \"image\": \"\", \"name\": \"Lootoffers24/7\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Lootoffers24-7-148\"}, \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"What is gravity?

The force of gravity keeps all of the planets in orbit around the sun.\\\\n\\\\nEvery object that has mass exerts a gravitational pull or force on every other mass. The strength of this pull depends on the masses of objects at play. Gravity is what keeps the planets in orbit around the sun and the moon around the Earth. Hence, we can say that\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n%3E Gravity is a force that attracts a body towards the centre of the earth, or towards any other physical body having mass.\\\\nHistory of Gravity\\\\n\\\\n * In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton first discovered gravity. While sitting under an apple tree, he noticed an apple falling down. Then he tried to figure out why the apple instead of going up or left or right, came down. In this situation, there was clearly an unknown force at play, that force is what Newton called gravity and his theory is called Newton\\\\u2019s law of Universal Gravitation.\\\\n * Later in the early 20th century, Albert Einstein developed a whole new idea about gravity. According to him, gravity is the warping of space and time.\\\\n * Gravity in Universe\\\\nGravity plays a major role in sustaining life on earth. It is because of the gravitational pull between the earth and the sun the atmosphere is kept in place and provides us with the air that we need to breathe in order to survive. It also keeps us at a safe distance from the sun allowing us to enjoy the sun\\\\u2019s light and warmth.\\\\n\\\\nMeasuring Gravity\\\\n\\\\nSir Issac Newton defined the force of gravity as follows:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n%3E \\\\u201cEvery particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\\\\u201d\\\\nMathematically, this translates to:\\\\n\\\\nF=Gm1m2/r2\\\\n\\\\nWhere,\\\\n\\\\n * F is the force,\\\\n * m1 and m2 are masses of the objects interacting\\\\n * r is the distance between the center of the masses\\\\n * G is the gravitational constant (6.674\\\\u00d710\\\\u221211 m3\\\\u22c5kg\\\\u22121\\\\u22c5s\\\\u22122)\\\\nThis equation gives the magnitude of the force and since it is an attractive force it will always be directed towards the other object. From the above equation, we can come to the conclusion that anything that has mass has gravity. Objects with heavier mass have more gravity.\\\\n\\\\nThe closer the two objects are, the heavier the gravitational pull between them. Gravity gets weaker with distance. The above formula is used to calculate the gravitational force between two objects.\\\\n\\\\n * Gravity is the weakest of the four known fundamental forces of nature, yet it is the most dominant force. Even though it is the weakest force, Gravity holds together the entire solar systems and galaxies.\\\\n * The speed of free fall is consistent over the surface of the earth. This means all objects fall at the same speed. This speed on earth is calculated to be 9.8 m/s.\\\\n * The best current estimate of G is that it equals about 6.67259\\\\u00d710\\\\u221211 newton-square meter per square kilogram.\\\\n * The force of attraction between you and the Earth is your weight.\\\\n * An object must travel 7 miles a second i.e. the earth\\\\u2019s escape velocity to leave Earth\\\\u2019s gravitational pull behind.\\\\n * The gravitational force on the moon is around 16% of that on Earth, Mars has around 38% of the Earth\\\\u2019s pull and Jupiter has 2.5 times the Earth\\\\u2019s gravity.\\\\n * Black Holes are the places in the universe that have strong gravity, that even light cannot escape from it.\\\\n * Gravity can bend light!\\\\n * According to Einstein, gravity is not a force.\\\\n * Gravity might be the weakest of the four fundamental forces, but it has an unlimited range.\\\\n\", \"upvoteCount\": 7, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-is-gravity?top_ans=265425111\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"affiliation\": {\"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"United States Navy\"}, \"answerCount\": 7421, \"description\": \"former  Electronic Warfare Technician at United States Navy (1990-1994)\", \"followerCount\": 5539, \"hasOccupation\": {\"@type\": \"Role\", \"endDate\": \"1994\", \"roleName\": \" Electronic Warfare Technician\", \"startDate\": \"1990\"}, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-16837859-100-iBHDKSgigkvS1SFeBawZifrcfT8Umbnx.jpeg\", \"name\": \"Scott Hanson\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Hanson-5\"}, \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"There is no gravity, there is a celestial thrust.

Both the curvature of space and the dilation of time seem to simply be empirical facts of our existence, and together these phenomena have convinced physicists that we are, at the very least, living in a four-dimensional reality called Space-Time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: it\\\\u2019s also becoming increasingly apparent that Space-Time, itself, is only an emergent property of some deeper and more fundamental reality. Nevertheless, as far as the established science is concerned this is our best current understanding of gravity.\\\\n\\\\nBeginning of the original answer:\\\\n\\\\nAccordingly, to our best theory, then, gravity is not a \\\\u201cforce of attraction\\\\u201d existing between objects but rather, according to the wildly successful theory of General Relativity, a deformation or curvature of Space-time, itself. So, allow me then to explain how this works:\\\\n\\\\nIn the image below, notice how the smaller object is traveling in a straight line from its own perspective\\\\u2014wait, whaaat? (yes this is strange but true as I will illustrate below) but appears from the perspective of the larger object (and our own) to be in orbit around it simply because of the curvature of space-time, i.e. the deformation of the surrounding space-time by the larger object. If you look closely you will see the smaller object also deforms space-time around itself, however, the degree of deformation depends on the relative mass of the objects in question, which in this illustration is represented by their relative size, as if both objects were made out of the same stuff. The degree of deformation actually depends on the mass of the object and not its size.\\\\n\\\\nGravity then is an effect that mass has on the warping of Space-Time. It essentially makes straight paths curved.\\\\n\\\\nIn the same way, if we project a straight line of an airplane flight following the curvature of the earth onto a flat map it appears to be curved, as is represented in the next illustration. This is called the \\\\u201cgreat circle\\\\u201d distance as geometrically it can be represented (when we dissect through the center of the Earth) to be circular on a flat plane. Great circle routes are a particular type of geodesic [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic ] and consequently are the shortest paths, hence a \\\\u201cstraight line\\\\u201d, around the surface of any sphere. If we were to imagine that the below illustration was then deformed to actually represent the curvature of the earth (and so represented a sphere) the curved line would then appear to be straight and the straight line would likewise appear to be curved, proving that it was the longer path on an actual globe, even if it still the shortest path on a flat map.\\\\n\\\\nSo what we learn from this is that whether a line appears to be straight or curved depends solely upon the geometry of the surface that line has been drawn on. . . . Earlier I mentioned that the smaller object was traveling in a straight line from its own perspective (of course from our perspective it looked clearly curved). So imagine you\\\\u2019re walking down a straight street\\\\u2014perhaps one that is on the equator and goes around the whole of our planet, then even though from your own perspective you appear to be walking in a straight line just as is our smaller sphere from another perspective then you would appear, say from the point of view of an observer in space, to be walking in curved path or orbit. In a similar way, gravity deforms the geometry of Space-time and this curvative then provides the appearance that objects are attracted to one another. However, it isn\\\\u2019t about attraction at all since there is no actual \\\\u201cforce of attraction\\\\u201d, whatsoever, between the objects in question.\\\\n\\\\nIf space were to be flattened out in the first image (much like it has been in the second image) then we can imagine the smaller object (still moving in a straight line) traveling away from the larger object exactly because there is no force of attraction acting between them, as illustrated in this next image.\\\\n\\\\nThe effect of gravity travels at the same speed as light, and so if the mass of the Sun disappeared all of a sudden (along with the curvature of space-time it produces) then it would take 8 minutes and 20 seconds before the effect of the Sun\\\\u2019s disappearance was felt on our planet, which would then \\\\u201cfly off\\\\u201d in a straight line (because again from the planet\\\\u2019s perspective it had been traveling in a straight line the whole time anyway, except that it had been traveling in a deformed space-time which would have now become flat.)\\\\n\\\\nEnd of the Original answer.\\\\n\\\\nWhat follows constitutes a postscript prompted by all the feedback\\\\u2014much of truly wonderful\\\\u2014this answer has received in the comments.\\\\n\\\\nEdit:\\\\n\\\\nAllow me a slight tangent (and excuse that math pun), through a cognitive theory called embodied cognition [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition ], we can understand that mathematical meaning, just like natural language, is a product of metaphorical extension. However, there is a profound difference between the two as natural language metaphors all depend on the concrete and particular, while mathematics is purely abstract (such as the metaphor of a number line\\\\u2014extend a number line in both the vertical and horizontal direction and you have the basis for Calculus because you then have a means of defining a curve and a line tangent to that curve).\\\\n\\\\nMathematics then allows us to describe metaphorically models of nature such as General Relativity. In other words, such a theory can be thought to be a metaphorical model that has been described rigorously and shown to be consistent (and also is predictive which the scientific part of it). However, there is no way to transfer the mathematical metaphor into metaphors of natural language and be able to hold on to that consistency. It just can\\\\u2019t be done, which is why it is necessary that in order to really understand the theory fully one must understand the theory mathematically. But if the question presupposed being able to do that then one could just google General relativity - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity ].\\\\n\\\\nMy hope here was to answer the question that left people with an intuitive sense for a very unintuitive idea about how the world works. The takeaway point needs only be that to the best of our current understanding gravity is not a force of attraction between objects but rather a curving of space (by which I really mean, you guessed it space-time) that causes objects moving through space (and time) to be \\\\u201csmashed\\\\u201d together, in the sense that your butt is being smashed against something if you happen to be sitting at the moment you\\\\u2019re reading this.\\\\n\\\\nI do, however, have another metaphor to help. Consider the following illustration:\\\\n\\\\nImagine this big yellow guy spinning around, creating a centripetal force on these other two guys. What keeps the other guys from flying off into space is the felt \\\\u201cforce of attraction\\\\u201d created by the rope (you could even imagine it having elastic properties). This rope then acts just like the force of gravity.\\\\n\\\\nNow one, last illustration :)\\\\n\\\\nIf this rope were to snap then we have a situation that is identical to one illustrated in the third illustration. This shows that whether we think of gravity as a force like a rope or as the curvature of space, the same behavior is being described. So, practically speaking, any effect that can be described by gravity as a force can also (more or less) be described by gravity as the curving of space. It might not be so intuitive to think of \\\\u201cwalking off a roof\\\\u201d and falling to the ground as a product of the curvature of space, as one comment to my answer put it, but it is easy if we think about it as a force of attraction. Nevertheless, the takeaway point is still that if it makes sense in this latter way then it can also be thought about in the former way as well, and so to the best of our present understanding gravity is the warping of Space-Time and not a force of attraction.\\\\n\\\\nEdit:\\\\n\\\\nBased on some of the comments, and against my better judgment, I am going to attempt to provide some information about the mathematics involved. There is an adage in the publishing industry that for every mathematical equation you include you will lose so many readers. I suppose if someone really had a sense of humor they would present that statement as a mathematical equation :)\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of humor, this seems like a good time for a math joke:\\\\n\\\\nA mathematician and his best friend, an engineer, attend a public lecture on geometry in thirteen-dimensional space.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"How did you like it?\\\\\" the mathematician wants to know after the talk.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"My head\\'s spinning\\\\\", the engineer confesses. \\\\\"How can you develop any intuition for thirteen-dimensional space?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Well, it\\'s not even difficult. All I do is visualize the situation in arbitrary N-dimensional space and then set N = 13.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSo at the risk of undoing everything I\\\\u2019ve attempted above, we need to talk about the mathematical genius Carl Friedrich Gauss  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss ]who was the first person to realize that more geometries than just Ecludian geometry were possible. Gauss had a student named Bernhard Riemann  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann ]who went on to develop these ideas more fully. In a lecture that is still famous among mathematicians today, Riemann showed in the 19th century how we may conceive such alternative geometries by imagining an extra dimension for whatever geometry we are describing (later Einstien will incorporate time as the fourth dimension of Space-time to allow for these alternative geometries as real facets of our the world in which we are actually living).\\\\n\\\\nHere is a video that covers some of the previous territory we\\\\u2019ve traversed and gets us a little farther still.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coPD3h8Iidc\\\\nOne thing I\\\\u2019ve come to realize about my answer is that although I kept stressing Space-time if you didn\\\\u2019t already know what I was talking about then the reason for this probably was being lost.\\\\n\\\\nWell, the reason as I\\\\u2019ve suggested is that we can use Reinmann\\\\u2019s insight to describe 3-d curvature in 4-d Space-time. Here is a video that gives you some sense of how the mathematics work.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgXOsRNbYiM\\\\nNow one last video that is really neat and hopefully will bring this all back into the realm of one\\\\u2019s non-mathematical intuition. This last video also brings us back to the first illustration in my answer, which is a nice symmetry, except now it isn\\\\u2019t simply a 2-d illustration of a 4-d event but rather one that while still limited gives you a much better intuition of what the deformation of space-time really means. Note especially how he gets a secondary orbit when two marbles are thrown together, around the 4:30 mark, because that\\\\u2019s really just awesome\\\\u2014and so it is a great way to end on the awesomeness of the picture of the universe in which the dynamic deformation of Space-time actually accounts for the seeming attraction between masses.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg\\\\nBonus video:\\\\n\\\\nWhy a Riemann surface, essentially the mathematical model of the 4-dimensions of Space-time, is impossible to represent in 3-dimensions (for those who keep asking for a more clear concrete analogy in natural language for the shape of Space-time). I am sorry but the theory we have for \\\\u201chow gravity is produced\\\\u201d can finally only be fully grasped in its mathematical expression. As you\\\\u2019ll see in the below video a 4-dimensional space is easily described with mathematics even if it\\\\u2019s impossible to truly ever visualize:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MmSZrAlqKc\\\\nAnd so here is one last thing to consider maybe the reason that Algebra is completely described only when using complex numbers in the 4-dimensions of complex functions is exactly because this is how the world really exists (or least the part of it dealing with our common experience) which seems to be the only part where gravity is actually important. At any rate, complex functions and the associated math resulting from them is enough to describe the geometry of 4-d Space-time and explain gravity as the deformation of this Space-time.\", \"upvoteCount\": 1283, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-gravity?top_ans=120342354\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 154, \"description\": \"Physician/hobby physicist\", \"followerCount\": 7885, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-2215301-100-vevwtrvkxmkgqmhsdzoxowgavbfxwfuk.jpeg\", \"knowsAbout\": \"Physics\", \"name\": \"Ramzi Amri\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Ramzi-Amri\"}, \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"What is gravity made of?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-is-gravity-made-of?no_redirect=1\"}, \"text\": \"Of the four fundamental forces that encompass all the interactions in the universe, gravity is the one we haven\\'t conclusively figured out yet.\\\\n\\\\nIf you stick very strictly to quantum theory and the principles of quantum mechanics we want gravity to be caused by a yet to be found elementary particle called the graviton.\\\\n\\\\nUntil that is proven, the current consensus still is that gravity is caused by the inherent curvature of spacetime, like Einstein described in his general theory of relativity.\", \"upvoteCount\": 26, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-is-gravity?top_ans=1130220\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 14, \"followerCount\": 28, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-96909468-100-ifcauzsesjpxyxehknvbjnofnhqfpujb.jpeg\", \"name\": \"Suyash Trivedi\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Suyash-Trivedi-3\"}, \"image\": [{\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-adebf0f76beb9a45f865fe6d91cdf02a-lq\"}], \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"Why is gravity so weak?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-gravity-so-weak?no_redirect=1\"}, \"text\": \"Of all the four fundamental forces, gravitational force is found to be the weakest. However, the question of \\\\u201cWhy is it so?\\\\u201d hasn\\'t been answered properly till now. This question is open to research. But physicists have formulated various theories for it, and string theory is one of them.\\\\n\\\\nTo understand string theory and it\\'s use in order to explain the weakness of gravity, let\\'s take an example.\\\\n\\\\nSuppose a person is walking on a rope like her.\\\\n\\\\nNow, she can move only in two directions - forward and backward. In other words, she can move only in one dimension.\\\\n\\\\nNow consider an ant on the same rope. Because of the small size of the ant, it can move forward, backward, sideways, or around the rope. In other words, it can move in all three possible dimensions.\\\\n\\\\nThis is somewhat similar to what scientists think about the quantum world. At the atomic scale, more branes (other than the one in which we think we are living) are observable than at the scale of sizes with which we deal in our daily lives.\\\\n\\\\nYou might ask what does the word \\'brane\\' mean. Well, brane is a mathematical term. However , simply speaking, a brane is a plane of existence (not exactly a plane). We can say that we live in a brane of four dimensions(3 space-1 time). However, physicists believe that at sub atomic sizes, presence of more than one brane can observed, much like our ant and rope example .\\\\n\\\\nNow coming to \\\\u2018gravity\\\\u2019 part. According to String theory, particles can be visualised as strings, even bosons( particles that act as mediators of all the 4 fundamental forces).For example, photon is the mediator of electromagnetic radiation, and hence is a boson. Similarly, graviton (still hypothetical) is considered to be mediator of gravitational force.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to explain the weakness of gravity, it has been proposed that all bosons, other than gravitons are open strings and and at least one of their ends are attached to the brane of our existence. However, graviton is supposed to be a circular string having no ends. Hence it\\'s not attached to our brane, and \\\\u201cleaks\\\\u201d into other branes, making gravity weaker than all other forces.\\\\n\\\\nIf according to brane theories [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_(M-theory) ], we live in a brane, this \\\\\"leakage\\\\\" of gravitons from the brane into higher-dimensional space(also termed as \\\\u2018bulk\\') could explain why gravitation is such a weak force, and gravitons from other branes adjacent to our own could provide a potential explanation for dark matter [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter ].\\\\n\\\\nPhysicists also think that gravity might be stronger at sub atomic dimensions because, other branes , to which gravitons likely \\'leak\\' are also observable at these sizes, as explained above.\\\\n\\\\nThis is all theoretical, but nevertheless is able to explain most of the stuff so far.\\\\n\\\\nSo keep exploring :)\", \"upvoteCount\": 18, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-gravity-so-weak?top_ans=85026230\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 2592, \"description\": \"Doctor of Physics, Writer of Code, Player of Games\", \"followerCount\": 58564, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-88603921-100-becfzzxabfjslqkxdpzgpuvhigoeebvb.jpeg\", \"name\": \"Jack Fraser-Govil\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Fraser-Govil\"}, \"image\": [{\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e9282efee4806e08105a5971972983d8-lq\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-739c91dab186ceb1ce17cd4283656590-lq\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2473578d18939cad2b1b7592218b7537-lq\"}], \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"Can gravity bend light?

The geodesic equations can be calculated in two ways: you can use the metric to calculate the metric connection [math]\\\\\\\\Gamma^\\\\\\\\alpha_{\\\\\\\\beta \\\\\\\\gamma}[/math], and then sum; or you can extremise the interval.\\\\n\\\\nThe equivalence of these two methods shows that geodesics are the shortest distance between two points in spacetime. They are the \\\\u201cstraight lines\\\\u201d in a curved spacetime.\\\\n\\\\nTo extremise a functional [math]\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}(x^0,\\\\\\\\dot{x}^0....x^n,\\\\\\\\dot{x}^n)[/math], we use the Euler-Lagrange equations [2] :\\\\n\\\\n[math]\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\partial}{\\\\\\\\partial p}\\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\partial \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\\\\\partial \\\\\\\\dot{x}^\\\\\\\\mu}\\\\\\\\right) -\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\partial \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\\\\\partial {x}^\\\\\\\\mu} =0  \\\\\\\\tag*{}[/math]\\\\n\\\\nWhere [math](x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3) = (ct,r,\\\\\\\\theta,\\\\\\\\phi)[/math], and the dot, [math]\\\\\\\\dot{x}[/math], indicates the derivative with respect to the affine parameter [math]p[/math] , such that [math]\\\\\\\\dot{x} = \\\\\\\\frac{dx}{dp}[/math].

We remember that in Newtonian mechanics, it was quite often easier to talk about changes in [math]\\\\\\\\frac{1}{r}[/math], than in [math]r[/math], we therefore hope this is true here (spoilers \\\\u2014 it is!).

Starting with the observation that gravitational acceleration doesn\\'t depend on the mass of the thing being accelerated, and going through the assumption that what you see under gravity should be the same as under acceleration, it works out a system that seems consistent with the whole universe. Energy/momentum distorts space-time, such that different observers disagree about what a straight line is. A planet orbiting around a sun is just going inertially, along what to it is a straight line. The math lets you work out what these paths, called \\\\\"geodesics,\\\\\" are.

Just saying \\\\\"no\\\\\" isn\\'t a very useful answer. After all, it is said that due to the expansion of the universe, there are some distant galaxies that are moving away from us faster than the speed of light. Now, they can\\'t actually move faster than light itself, because the laws of physics over there are supposed to be the same as the laws of physics over here---that means that if light itself is being emitted from such a faraway galaxy, away from us, that light will be travelling faster than the galaxy itself, which is in turn travelling faster than c. And if that\\'s the case then the speed of light isn\\'t really constant, is it?\\\\n\\\\nAnd what about light very near the event horizon of a black hole? We know that, in theory, light emitted outward just at the event horizon is supposed to take an infinite amount of time to escape (from the point of view of an outside observer). It\\'s \\\\\"stuck\\\\\" at the event horizon. (But an observer falling into the hole has a different view: to them, the light is indeed travelling outward at c, but the event horizon is also expanding at speed c.)\\\\n\\\\nIn order to understand what\\'s going on, you need to know a bit about both special and general relativity.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s start with something very basic. Speed is distance over time. Therefore, in order to calculate the speed of something, you need a coordinate system, so you can measure space and you can measure time. General relativity is, in a sense, all about coordinate systems. That\\'s what makes this question so interesting.\\\\n\\\\nLet me give you an example of how to measure coordinates so that the speed of light does not appear constant. Say we start out in one coordinate system or frame, which we\\'ll denote by K, in which the speed of light is numerically equal to 1. Each point is given the coordinates (ct, x, y, z). Then we perform a change of coordinates into a new frame, K\\'. A point with coordinates (ct, x, y, z) in K is given the coordinates (ct\\', x\\', y\\', z\\') in K\\', where\\\\n\\\\nct\\' = ct\\\\nx\\' = x\\\\ny\\' = y\\\\nz\\' = A exp(z / B)\\\\n\\\\nwhere A and B are constants with the units of length.\\\\n\\\\nNow imagine that in K, light travels straight \\\\\"up\\\\\" for an infinitesimal interval of time, from the starting point (0, 0, 0, z) to (c dt, 0, 0, z + c dt). In K\\', the light will be observed to travel from (0, 0, 0, A exp(z/B)) to (c dt, 0, 0, A exp((z + c dt)/B)). The instantaneous velocity in the new frame is therefore obtained by differentiating z\\' with respect to z:\\\\n\\\\nv\\' = dz\\'/dt\\' = c dz\\'/(c dt\\') = cA/B exp(z/B) = cz\\'/B\\\\n\\\\nIn other words, in K\\', the higher up you are, the faster the speed of light appears when the light is aimed straight up! If you aim the light straight up, it will apparently accelerate. But if you aim the light straight down, then it\\'ll approach z = 0 asymptotically. If you aim the light in the x or y directions, its speed is simply\\\\n\\\\nv\\' = c.\\\\n\\\\nSo in K, the propagation of light was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, but in K\\', it is neither!\\\\nNow, you could object that it is silly and unreasonable to use a coordinate system such as K\\', and, in special relativity, you would be right. We are now getting into the heart of special relativity. Unfortunately, this issue is not often explored carefully, but it is crucial for understanding what it really means when we say \\\\\"the speed of light is constant in special relativity\\\\\". For this important postulate of special relativity is used to predict real, measurable phenomena such as as time dilation and length contraction. If these phenomena really do show precise agreement with special relativity, then that implies that the speed of light really is constant; and that in turn implies that there is something stopping us from using non-inertial frames like K\\'.\\\\n\\\\nK\\' is not a reasonable frame of reference because it is not the natural frame of reference for an observer in free fall in flat space [1]. For the natural assumption for me, as an observer, would be that I can measure space using metre sticks and I can measure time with a clock. So I carry with me three metre sticks, and orient the metre sticks so that they are mutually perpendicular. Then I declare that my position is the origin (remember, in my frame of reference, I consider myself stationary) and I assign coordinates to points near me by using these three metre sticks as my coordinate axes. To assign coordinates to faraway points, in principle, I could set up a three-dimensional lattice of identical metre sticks throughout space, with six metre sticks incident upon each lattice point. Then I grab a bunch of identical, synchronized clocks and attach each one to a point in the lattice. [2] Here\\'s a diagram from Spacetime Physics by Taylor and Wheeler:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow I can measure both time and space everywhere: the space coordinates are determined by how many metre sticks you have to traverse to get to a point, in each direction, and time is determined by the reading on the clock at the point where an event occurs.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I define my coordinate system in this \\\\\"natural\\\\\" way, starting out in free fall in flat space, by sending light signals from one point to another, I can determine experimentally that the speed of light is independent of the source point, the initial time, the destination point, the final time, the direction of travel, the movement of the source, and the movement of the detector. In other words, the frame I will construct \\\\\"naturally\\\\\" will be a frame similar to K, not K\\'.\\\\n\\\\nThe standard treatments of special relativity ask you to proceed by imagining a boost. What this basically means is that you grab a bunch of metre sticks and clocks, and you burn some rocket fuel for a moment, so now you have a constant velocity relative to the origin (as seen in frame K). Although you\\'re moving relative to frame K, an observer always considers themselves to be standing still, so you can imagine constructing a network of metre sticks and clocks around you, where you consider yourself to be at the origin. Having done this, you will find the same constant speed of light as you did before, when you were in frame K. That is an experimentally observable fact and the basic postulate of special relativity. From this we derive time dilation, length contraction, and so on.\\\\n\\\\nSpecial relativity promises you that you\\'ll be able to construct a frame such as K in the natural way and that it will have a constant speed of light; and furthermore, if you start at rest in such a frame and then accelerate so that you have constant velocity relative to it, and you construct your new frame in the natural way, it will also have a constant speed of light. It all depends on the frames being constructed in this way; as I previously pointed out, a frame like K\\' does not have a constant speed of light. As you may already know, frames like K are called inertial frames. The speed of light is constant in inertial frames. Not in frames like K\\', which are non-inertial. Just in inertial frames.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe construction of an inertial frame in special relativity depends upon the space being flat---which it is, of course, because special relativity is not a theory of gravitation. And small regions of space-time are indeed very nearly flat---unless of course they are close to black holes or other very dense bodies. That\\'s why special relativity is a useful theory. It\\'s good enough for our particle physics experiments, some of which are the most precise experiments performed to date.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ve seen that in flat space-time, there\\'s always some inertial frame---a frame in which the speed of light is globally constant. And, indeed, it makes sense to use such a frame to actually do the physics, because it is the \\\\\"natural\\\\\" frame for a free observer in flat space-time, whereas non-inertial frames---accelerating frames---are the natural frames for accelerating observers---and free observers in flat space-time are not  supposed to be accelerating. And we can make the coordinate speed of light appear non-constant by using a weird frame, but it\\'s only because of the weirdness of the frame.\\\\n\\\\nNow imagine you\\'re a freely falling observer in curved space-time. Freely falling means you\\'re not under the influence of any non-gravitational forces. Note that astronauts in the Space Station, in orbit around the Earth, are freely falling, which is why the inside of the Space Station seems like an inertial frame, and thrown objects appear to travel in straight lines. (The reason why gravitational forces are special is the equivalence principle: every object feels the same amount of gravitational acceleration, regardless of its mass or composition.)\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s going to happen if you try to follow the same procedure for constructing an inertial frame---assembling a grid out of identical metre sticks and identical clocks---is that something is going to go wrong. The angles of a quadrilateral might not add to 360 degrees, and so our attempt to construct a cubical lattice of metre sticks would be foiled. Or we might be able to set up the lattice, but clocks at different points would run at different rates!\\\\n\\\\nOver a small region of space-time you\\'d be fine. But the larger the region, the more deviation you\\'d observe from flatness, and the more variation you\\'d observe in the speed of light. Since there\\'s no way to line up all the metre sticks and keep all the clocks synchronized, there is no such thing as a \\\\\"natural\\\\\" frame to use, whether you\\'re freely falling or acted on by a (non-gravitational) force; your choice of a frame is, in effect, going to be an arbitrary assignment of coordinates to points. And so it\\'s clear that the speed of light cannot be globally constant; there is simply no meaning to such a statement since you can use whatever coordinate system you want, and whatever the speed of light is in one frame, it\\'ll be different in another. [3] The inability to construct a \\\\\"natural\\\\\" frame, and the inability to find a frame in which the speed of light is globally constant, form the essence of the concept of space-time curvature.\\\\n\\\\nAnd that\\'s why distant galaxies seem to be moving away from us faster than the speed of light: the universe is curved and it is so big that the effects of curvature are significant. Galaxies can be individually freely falling and yet get further and further away from each other---that can only happen in a curved space-time. [4] And if the speed of light is c when the light being observed is close by, then we can\\'t expect it to be c for objects far, far away, so far away that curvature can no longer be neglected. Those galaxies are not travelling faster than light, for light itself travelling in the same direction would be travelling even faster than the galaxies. It\\'s simply not possible to construct a frame of reference in which the speed of light is globally constant across the entire universe.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIs there a sense in which the speed of light is constant even in a gravitational field, however? Yes, there is. For a curved manifold always looks flat if you zoom in closely enough; and, in the same way, curved space-time seems flat if you restrict your attention to a sufficiently small region. [5] That\\'s why the curvature of the universe isn\\'t noticeable in our labs here on Earth.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, when I stand on the surface of the Earth, I do notice the curvature due to the Earth\\'s gravitational field, since when I release an apple from rest, it falls straight down. In order for space-time to appear flat, your reference frame has to be a freely falling one, like the Space Station (considered earlier). When an astronaut in the Space Station releases an apple from rest, the apple seems to be stationary. Of course, from the Earth\\'s frame of reference, the apple is actually in orbit, but adopting the reference frame of the Space Station makes space seem locally flat.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you fall freely, and you carry a bunch of tiny metre sticks and clocks, you can construct a very nearly inertial frame of reference in your immediate vicinity. And when you do that, you will observe the propagation of light to be very nearly homogeneous and isotropic---just in your immediate vicinity.\\\\n\\\\nMathematically, light propagates along null geodesics. A null geodesic is a curve every part of which is assigned a length zero by the metric. In equations,\\\\n[math]g_{\\\\\\\\mu\\\\\\\\nu} u^\\\\\\\\mu u^\\\\\\\\nu = 0[/math]\\\\nIn flat space-time, the metric is given by diag(+1, -1, -1, -1), and that implies that when light travels by a tiny increment [math]\\\\\\\\mathrm{d}(ct)[/math] in the time direction, the spatial distances [math]\\\\\\\\mathrm{d}x, \\\\\\\\mathrm{d}y, \\\\\\\\mathrm{d}z[/math] must satisfy\\\\n[math](\\\\\\\\mathrm{d}(ct))^2 - (\\\\\\\\mathrm{d}x)^2 - (\\\\\\\\mathrm{d}y)^2 - (\\\\\\\\mathrm{d}z^2) = 0[/math]\\\\nwhich says that light travels at speed c.\\\\nIf the metric is not the Minkowski metric, it is possible to find a coordinate transformation that gives a locally inertial frame, in which the metric is in the form diag(+1, -1, -1, -1) at the origin (location of the observer) and at nearby points (the partial derivatives of the metric components vanish). In such a frame, the equation above will hold near the origin. Note that in such a frame, since the observer sees the flat metric nearby, the observer necessarily doesn\\'t see any local gravitational effects---which is only possible if the observer is freely falling.\\\\n\\\\nAnd so the speed of light is locally constant in the presence of gravity, which is just another way of saying that curved space-time looks like the flat space-time of relativity when you zoom in enough and you are freely falling. But as soon as that light gets a significant distance away, you can no longer count on its coordinate speed being the same anymore.\\\\n\\\\n[1] i.e., not acted on by any forces, gravitational or otherwise.\\\\n[2] Note that in order to avoid the effects of time dilation, the clocks have to be moved very slowly to their destinations.\\\\n[3] If, in fact, you managed to find a frame in which the speed of light is globally constant, then by definition the space-time you\\'re in is  actually flat, and you just started out with a weird coordinate system  in the first place so it didn\\'t look flat to you.\\\\n[4] N.B. So the expansion of the universe is really a manifestation of the particular way in which our universe is curved.\\\\n[5] A consequence is that the sum of angles of a triangle in curved space will more and more closely approach 180 degrees as you make the triangle smaller and smaller.\", \"upvoteCount\": 550, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Does-gravity-affect-the-speed-of-light?top_ans=8084684\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 30, \"description\": \"Nerds can be funny !\", \"followerCount\": 952, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-39422839-100-qkficsdyelhzxteydyvmqzrciqgqdtmm.jpeg\", \"knowsAbout\": \"Physics\", \"name\": \"Krishna Patel\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Krishna-Patel-40\"}, \"image\": [{\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-10675d29e9f87e446bfdb08ece80a636-pjlq\"}], \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"Why is gravity not acting on a fire\\\\u2019s flame?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-gravity-not-acting-on-a-fire\\\\u2019s-flame?no_redirect=1\"}, \"text\": \"Surprisingly, gravity itself is the reason why the flame rises upwards!\\\\n\\\\nObserve the image below:\\\\n\\\\nAn elongated flame is observed when the candle is burning in the presence of gravity.

This liberated heat warms up the burning gases and combustion products. This hot air, being less dense, rises up and the cold air rushes in to occupy that vacant place. As cold air is heavier, it stays. This form of motion of air is called convection and this is what keeps the flame upright and elongated when the candle is lit in the presence of gravity.\\\\n\\\\nWhen there is no effective gravity, while there is both cold and hot air, and while they are both more dense and less dense respectively, the absense of a net gravitational force means that bouyant forces do not exist.

Or, in the language of a (nonexistent, as of now) quantum field theory of gravity, gravitons interact with gravitons.\\\\n\\\\nOne way to think of gravity interacting with itself... well, a splendid example is presented by the famous GW150914 burst of gravitational waves. The source, supposedly, was a pair of black holes weighing 36 and 29 solar masses; after they coalesced, the resulting Kerr black hole weighed only about 62 solar masses. Where did that mass deficit come from? After all, you cannot suck mass-energy out of a black hole, not even with gravity. Well... as the progenitor black holes were approaching each other, the gravitational potential energy between them was becoming more and more negative. In response, the black holes accelerated (to nearly the speed of light!) building up positive kinetic energy, so the total energy remained constant (energy conservation). And a lot of that kinetic energy, in turn, was radiated away in the form of gravitational waves, slowing the black holes down, ultimately causing them to collide.\\\\n\\\\nSo the individual black holes still weigh 36 and 29 solar masses at the moment of the collision. But the sum of their remaining kinetic energy and the (negative) gravitational potential energy between them amounted to an additional minus 3 solar masses worth of mass energy. And thus the total mass of the system comes to only 62 solar masses.\\\\n\\\\nAnother case where gravity interacts with itself is that of a \\\\\"ray\\\\\" of gravitational wave in the presence of a gravitational field. Well... the same thing that happens to a ray of light... it bends in the presence of gravity. So the gravity that is responsible for deflecting starlight as it grazes the Sun also deflects gravitational waves.\\\\n\\\\nSo yes, gravity very much affects gravity. Of course gravity affects everything very weakly, and gravity itself is no exception... we really need colossal astrophysical events like GW150914 for this to become noticeable.\", \"upvoteCount\": 173, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Can-gravity-affect-gravity?top_ans=20154458\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 183, \"followerCount\": 298, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-71275343-100-fbrzgqrwdeneqthcuzpydfrrzkgfjgoy.jpeg\", \"name\": \"Kartikaye Bhardwaj\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Kartikaye-Bhardwaj\"}, \"image\": [{\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ca037874768c088d55bfd9095891c704-lq\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d25ff531dcf74492481f02a19d255215\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-20f597d7956e4931703a9622adbe457b-lq\"}], \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"How does Gravity exist?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/How-does-Gravity-exist?no_redirect=1\"}, \"text\": \"Gravity.\\\\n\\\\nThe average person probably doesn\\\\u2019t think about it on a daily basis, but yet gravity affects our every move. Because of gravity, we fall down (not up), objects crash to the floor, and we don\\\\u2019t go flying off into space when we jump in the air. The old adage, \\\\u201ceverything that goes up must come down\\\\u201d makes perfect sense to everyone because from the day we are born, we are seemingly bound to Earth\\\\u2019s surface due to this all-pervasive invisible force.\\\\n\\\\nBut physicists think about gravity all the time. To them, gravity is one of the mysteries to be solved in order to get a complete understanding of how the Universe works.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what is gravity and where does it come from?\\\\n\\\\nWith his theory of relativity, Albert Einstein explained how gravity is more than just a force: it is a curvature in the space-time continuum. That sounds like something straight out of science fiction, but simply put, the mass of an object causes the space around it to essentially bend and curve. This is often portrayed as a heavy ball sitting on a rubber sheet, and other smaller balls fall in towards the heavier object because the rubber sheet is warped from the heavy ball\\\\u2019s weight.\\\\n\\\\nIn reality, we can\\\\u2019t see curvature of space directly, but we can detect it in the motions of objects. Any object \\\\u2018caught\\\\u2019 in another celestial body\\\\u2019s gravity is affected because the space it is moving through is curved toward that object. It is similar to the way a coin would spiral down one of those penny slot cyclone machines you see at tourist shops, or the way bicycles spiral around a velodrome.\\\\n\\\\nA 2-dimensional animation of how gravity works. Via NASA\\\\u2019s Space Place..\\\\n\\\\nWe can also see the effects of gravity on light in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. If an object in space is massive enough \\\\u2013 such as a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies \\\\u2014 it can cause an otherwise straight beam of light to curve around it, creating a lensing effect.\\\\n\\\\nImages from the Hubble Space Telescope showing a gravitational lensing effect. Credit: NASA/ESA.\\\\n\\\\nOur understanding of gravity breaks down at both the very small and the very big: at the level of atoms and molecules, gravity just stops working. And we can\\\\u2019t describe the insides of black holes and the moment of the Big Bang without the math completely falling apart.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem is that our understanding of both particle physics and the geometry of gravity is incomplete.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cHaving gone from basically philosophical understandings of why things fall to mathematical descriptions of how things accelerate down inclines from Galileo, to Kepler\\\\u2019s equations describing planetary motion to Newton\\\\u2019s formulation of the Laws of Physics, to Einstein\\\\u2019s formulations of relativity, we\\\\u2019ve been building and building a more comprehensive view of gravity.

At that time he was not able to identify the cause of gravity and consider gravity as some sort of force.\\\\n\\\\nThe new Gravity\\\\n\\\\nThis is the most accepted and practically proven theory of gravity which is given by none other than Einstein in his general theory of relativity.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea of all of this is start with the simple thought which Einstein called his happiest thought of life, He imagine a man falling from the roof and he is under free fall according to Einstein this free-falling man does not feel the effect of gravity, in short, you jump from the top roof and gravity just goes away, means you can no longer feel the force of gravity.\\\\n\\\\nOk, I know WTF!!! Please wait I\\'ll explain my point.\\\\n\\\\nThe thing is when you detach yourself with the surface of the earth (means free fall) gravity does not act on You. You can do this practically lets Take to two balls one is very heavy lets say 5kg and another ball is 5gm here you can see mass difference is sufficient, now both balls are in your hand and you and balls are in contact with earth, now when you drop those balls, at the moment of drop, balls are detached from earth and are in free fall and finally you see that both the balls hit the ground at the exact same time ( if air resistance neglected) now remember what I told earlier any object under free fall no longer feels force of gravity and that is exactly happing here, if gravity acts on balls then we know that heavier mass ball hit the ground first according to newton But that\\'s not happening here so what\\'s the case.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is going on here?\\\\n\\\\nTwo balls are hitting the surface at the same time and this happened because they hadn\\'t fallen, They are stationery at there position, it\\'s the earth that comes up and hit them. you can see that balls are going down because you are in direct contact with earth and along with earth you are also going up, but when you see balls relative to earth you see balls are going down.\\\\n\\\\nAnd hence you can say that it is not the apple that falls in the newtons head but it\\'s the head of newton which hits the apple. It\\'s simple relative motion and you can\\'t feel that because you are in direct contact with earth which is accelerating upward (radially), if you detach your self with earth ( lets say you jump) your acceleration beaks\\' but earth is still accelerating up so you remain in air and earth hits to your feet. According to your perspective, you fall toward the earth, but in reality, the earth comes towards you and that\\'s how we feel gravity.\\\\n\\\\nThis principle is given by Einstein which is called the equivalence principle.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to this principle, gravity is not a force but it\\'s a sense of acceleration, or you can say gravity is due to acceleration between two bodies.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s prove this, imagine you are in a deep space Far away from the earth where there is no gravity. Now imagine there is an elevator floating in a space and you are inside the elevator. until now there is no gravity. Now let\\'s assume this elevator starts to accelerate upward at 9.8 m/s2 suddenly you will fall and hit yourself on the surface of elevator, and you will feel you are standing on the surface of the earth. Now assume that this elevator as earth surface and you will feel what I want to say.\\\\n\\\\nNow, These questions came in mind?\\\\n\\\\nFirst, why gravity is due to acceleration? and Why earth is accelerating in the first place?\\\\n\\\\nsecond, earth is spherical so how it is possible that it is accelerating upward in all the directions at the same time?\\\\n\\\\nFirst\\\\n\\\\nI will try to make it short and simple so lets see, we all know mass is the most fundamental property of matter hence matter has mass and when this mass is present in 4 dimensional space-time (its a fabric of space and time ) It warps(curves) the fabric of space-time and flat face space-time becomes curved. mass tells space how to curve, and curved space tells matter how to move and that how acceleration comes into the picture. And gravity is defined as the intensity of this curve, more the curve in space more the acceleration and hence more the gravity. It means curve in space made by the sun is much larger than the curve made by earth due to mass difference and that\\'s why the earth is under the curve of the sun (under its gravity) and rotating about the sun.( it does not fall into sun because the earth has its own curve also)\\\\n\\\\nYou may be heard that black holes has very high gravity, that light even does not pass through it. This is because all the mass of black holes are concentrated in a single point (almost infinite density) and you know that mass makes curve in space, now if mass is distributed in a large area it makes large curve but this curve is not deep it\\'s only large (in case of earth and sun) means you can feel gravity upto far distanceses but the force of gravity is not high. Now in case of black holes, the curve is not largely distributed but it is very deep, it is so much deep that space and time become a point there therefore inside The blackhole space and time does not exist and due To this deep space-time curve results into hight gravity in a very small region.\\\\n\\\\nsecond\\\\n\\\\nDue to mass there is a curve in space and due to this curve there is an acceleration and due to this acceleration, there is a sense of gravity. But how it is possible to accelerate a spherical object upward in all the directions (means radially) at the same time.(if this happened earth will tear apart into peaces)\\\\n\\\\nHere the earth is accelerating radially but it is not accelerating in 3-dimensional space it\\'s accelerating in 4-dimensional space-time and it is very difficult or next to impossible to imagine 4th dimensions, because we can only perceive in 3 dimensions But I think you get the idea.\\\\n\\\\nps: I hope you may get some idea about gravity I am not a scientist or something but I try my best to put this in the most simplest way, so that some sort of clarity may generate.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for reading...\", \"upvoteCount\": 14, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-is-gravity?top_ans=172692211\"}], \"text\": \"What is gravity?\", \"upvoteCount\": 412}}\\n        </script>\\n    <title>What is gravity? - Quora</title><link rel=\\'icon\\' href=\\'https://qsf.cf2.quoracdn.net/-4-images.favicon-new.ico-26-07ecf7cd341b6919.ico\\' /><meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noarchive\" /><meta property=\\'fb:app_id\\' content=\\'136609459636\\' /><meta property=\\'og:title\\' content=\\'What is gravity?\\' /><meta property=\\'og:type\\' content=\\'article\\' /><meta property=\\'og:site_name\\' content=\\'Quora\\' /><meta property=\\'og:image\\' content=\\'https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-custom-t-1991-600x315-jilmkraklzxhwilpxbkvfjflhmmthmmb.jpeg\\' /><meta property=\\'og:url\\' content=\\'https://www.quora.com/What-is-gravity\\' /><meta property=\\'og:description\\' content=\\'Answer (1 of 361): I&#039;ll write a higher-level answer, expecting others will give &quot;It&#039;s the force that causes mass/energy to attract&quot; answer. \\n\\n\\nWe have two really fundamental answers to this question.

Where did that mass deficit come from? After all, you cannot suck mass-energy out of a black hole, not even with gravity. Well... as the progenitor black holes were approaching each other, the gravitational potential energy between them was becoming more and more negative. In response, the black holes accelerated (to nearly the speed of light!) building up positive kinetic energy, so the total energy remained constant (energy conservation).

It can be describe as an attraction between the masses too, this description is nearer to our intuitive perception, as the older Newtonian view. Einstein proved his vision was more correct by showing that even light change its path, so its not necessary mass to be affected by the curvature in space (everything has mass, even light, but so insignificant that would not explain the effect).

Mass tells space how to curve, and space in turn tells mass how to move. The more mass in a particular volume of space, the more that space is curved. This can be imagined by placing some heavy object, such as a bowling ball in the middle of a trampoline. The mass of the ball will cause a depression in the trampoline. If another round object, like a baseball, is placed anywhere else on the trampoline, it will roll toward the bowling ball because the trampoline is no longer flat, but curved radially outward from the bowling ball. If the trampoline were flat, there would be no net force to push the baseball in any particular direction along it\\'s surface. But because the trampoline is curved toward the bowling ball, there is a small force toward the bowling ball. As you get closer to the bowling ball, the trampoline curves more and more toward the bowling ball, and the baseball wants to accelerate and roll faster and faster as it gets closer to the bowling ball.\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"modifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {}}], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"indent\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"quoted\\\\\\\\\\\\\": false, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"plain\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"is_rtl\\\\\\\\\\\\\": false}, {\\\\\\\\\\\\\"spans\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The nice thing about using a trampoline as an analogy is that you can roll the baseball in some direction not toward the bowling ball, and it will fall into an orbit around the bowling ball.

In fact, even though we\\'ve had the GR description of gravity for more than 100 years, most of the orbital mechanics calculations that NASA has done for its probes has been done using Newton\\'s laws because in most cases where NASA does their work, the GR calculation would only yield a very tiny correction on Newton\\'s results.\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"modifiers\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {}}], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"indent\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"quoted\\\\\\\\\\\\\": false, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"plain\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"is_rtl\\\\\\\\\\\\\": false}, {\\\\\\\\\\\\\"spans\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"So there ya go.

Relativity theory lacks any empirical support for its involvement with gravity. There is no empirical evidence for either space or time either suffering effects caused by objects or causing effects upon objects.

There are no controlled specimens of either time or space located in any laboratory anywhere. There has been no experimentation directly upon the properties of space or time.
