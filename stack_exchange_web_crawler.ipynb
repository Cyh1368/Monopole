With that being said... you can connect to the RDS instance via a VPN that can be stood up in EC2 that has rules open to the RDS instance. This would allow you to connect to the VPN on whatever developer machine and then access the RDS instance as if your dev box was in the VPC. This is my preferred method because it is more secure.

       "  'answer': [\"\\nOk, since this is apparently useful to some I will post - to the best of what I remember - an answer to this. I will answer this more broadly and not too AWS-specific because a) I don't use this instance anymore and b) I also don't remember perfectly how I did this.\\nBut I gained experience with PostreSQL and since AWS RDS was also just a postgres instance the steps should work quite similar.\\nHere are my recommended steps when restoring a postgreSQL DB instance:\\n\\nPull the backup in a .dump-format and not in .sql-format. Why? The file-size will be smaller and it is easier to restore. Do this with the following command:\\n\\npg_dump -h <your_public_dns_ending_with.rds.amazonaws.com> -U <username_for_your_db> -Fc <name_of_your_db> > name_for_your_backup.dump\\n\\nNow you can restore the backup easily to any postgreSQL instance. In general I'd recommend to set up a fresh DB instance with a new username and new databasename. Let's say you have a DB that is called testname with superuser testuser. Then you can just do:\\n\\npg_restore --no-owner --no-privileges --role=testuser -d testname <your_backup_file.dump>\\nAnd that should restore your instance.\\nWhen restoring to AWS or to any remote postgreSQL instance you will have to specify the host with the -h-flag. So this might be something like:\\npg_restore -h <your_public_dns_ending_with.rds.amazonaws.com> -p 5432 --no-owner --no-privileges --role=testuser -d testname <your_backup_file.dump>\\nIf you have a DB-instance running on a remote linux server, the host will be be your remote IP-address (-h <ip_od_server>) and the rest will be the same.\\nI hope this helps. Any questions please comment and I'll try my best to help more.\\n\"],\n",
