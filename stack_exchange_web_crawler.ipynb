I have a feeling that $A$ is positive definite only if $A$ is symmetric and (after running the algorithm) all of the diagonal elements are positive. Is this correct? (Or is there some other way to determine whether $A$ is positive definite, from its LU decomposition?\\nEdit:\\nElsewhere on the same Wikipedia page it says\\n\\nIf $A$ is a symmetric ... positive definite matrix, we can arrange matters so that $U$ is the ... transpose of $L$. That is, we can write $A$ as\\n$$A = L L^T$$\\nThis decomposition is called the Cholesky decomposition.\\n\\nMoreover I have read somewhere that a matrix is positive definite if and only if its Cholesky decomposition exists. But I don\\'t know how to put all this together (e.g. what \"arrange matters\" above means exactly) to determine from the LU decomposition whether the matrix is positive definite.\\n',\n",

I did notice on the ac adaptor power cord that one was black and one had white/grey dashes on it so i broke open the power adaptor and i noticed the wire that had the just black sleeve seems to connect to the + on the board and the wire with the dashes on it connected to the other one. so i assume the black is postivie and the dashes one is negative/ground\\nwhen i cut the tip off of the 19v power adaptor, it was different. it had a wire in the middle and then had another wire all around kinda acting like a shield. so now i dont know out of these ones which is positive or negative. i cant crack open the 19v power adaptor and trace cuz i dont wanna end up breaking it.\\nso how does this work? is the shielding one negative and the middle one is positive? if so then i can just connect it to the other + and - and be good to go. or does it matter what the pin polarity is on the tip?\\ni attached some pics\\nany help would be appreciated.\\nhere are pics\\nPics of wires\\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/7IrDT.jpg\\n',\n",

Thanks is advance!\\nI have defined the following 4x4 matrix:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nS=\\\\left(\\n         \\\\begin{array}{cccc}\\n           \\\\frac{1}{r^2}  & 1 & 1 & t\\\\sqrt{x}\\\\\\\\\\n           1 & \\\\frac{1}{t^2} & 1 &  \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{x}}{t}\\\\\\\\\\n           1 & 1 & 1 & \\\\sqrt{q} \\\\\\\\\\n           t\\\\sqrt{x} & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{x}}{t} & \\\\sqrt{q} & 1\\n         \\\\end{array}\\n       \\\\right).\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $(t,r)$ are two parameters (which I can choose arbitrarily to be any value in the segment $(0,1]$) and $(x,q)$ are the variables (each over the domain $[0,1]$). \\nNow, for a fixed pair of $(r,t)$ I want to plot a region of $(x,q)$ over which the matrix $S$ is positive semi-definite (I want it to be a valid covariance matrix). The thing is that when I try to use the Manipulate function (manipulation on $(r,t)\\\\in(0,1]^2$), and plotting the region of $(x,t)$, nothing shows.\\nNamely, Iv'e written the following:\\nS={{1/r^2, 1, 1, t Sqrt[x]}, {1, 1/t^2, 1, Sqrt[x]/t}, \\n   {1, 1, 1, Sqrt[q]}, {t Sqrt[x], Sqrt[x]/t, Sqrt[q], 1}};\\n\\nManipulate[\\n  RegionPlot[PositiveDefiniteMatrixQ[S], \\n             {x, 0, 1}, {q, 0, 1}], {r, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 1}]\\n\\nand I get an empty graph no matter what values I set for $(r,t)$. You might say that maybe this matrix is never positive semi-definite, but the strange this is that if I manually input numerical values to $(r,t)$ and plot the region, everything works fine.\\nI really need to manipulate over all possible parameter value of $(r,t)$. What is wrong here and how can I fix it?\\nMoreover, is it possible for Mathematica to parametrically find a local minima of a certain function (of the variable $q$ where $(r,t,x)$ serve as parameters) subject to the constraint that the above matrix must be positive semi-definite? If so, it would very much help me to know how to formalize such a command.\\n\",\n",

(please do not be constrained by this guideline it is meant to guide your answer not limit your options)\\nI have seen other posts derailed and confusion in the literature by the perception that negative matter = \\nanti mattter (this is a problem Could negative matter/energy exist in a stable state?). By negative energy / matter I mean the quantifiable class of stuff generated by the casimir effect (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_mass) and not other exotic particles / energy such as anti-matter. Additionally the casimir effect, which creates negative energy is well documented and adheres to relativity.\\n',\n",
       "  'answer': ['\\nNegative Mass is Very Confusing\\nI\\'ll just start with this: the behavior of negative mass would be really, really confusing, assuming many of the models we use in physics apply here. (Which is what I\\'m doing.)\\nMathematically, it\\'s easy to compensate for: you just throw a negative sign wherever you see mass. Understanding how that negative sign affects things, however, is what really boggles the mind.\\nFor instance, if you push it, it pushes back, but not only in the Newton\\'s Laws sort of way. You throw a (normal) ball at a lump of this stuff, and the matter pushed into the ball instead of moving with it. Because of its negative mass, the force you apply goes negative: it experiences a pull when normal matter experiences a push.\\nIt falls up.\\nYou push from behind to make it slow down.\\nFriction can make it speed up. (Surface friction, anyways, because it\\'s based on the normal force, which is based off of the object\\'s mass, which is now negative!)\\nIt still follows the right-hand rule of electromagnetism. Okay, that isn\\'t abnormal on its own, but if certainly feels abnormal given the other odd things this matter does. This indifference to electrical forces to will be the key to manipulating and shooting this stuff.\\nNegative Mass Projectiles\\nIf a negative-mass thing has electric charge (or can be induced to have electric charge), you can use something like the Lorentz-Force and make a railgun-like weapon. Normal accelerants, like gunpowder, would cause the negative-mass projectile to fly into the center of the explosion! I\\'m not sure how this would work with a barrel, where this would compress the exploding gases further, but I can say with reasonable certainty this is a bad idea.\\nWhat happens when it collies with something? The (positive) mass object reacts as normal. The negative mass projectile will, instead of bouncing off, stay with the object. Indeed, running into an object may even increase it\\'s speed! This is because the reaction force, which normally causes a projectile to slow, will actually cause it to speed up instead!\\nOf course, this is speculation: we don\\'t have negative mass objects around to do tests on. Just like many other things, we will not know for sure until we test it. Maybe negative mass objects have different physics that the standard models doesn\\'t account for?\\nNegative Energy?\\n\"Negative energy\" doesn\\'t really mean much. It just means the energy involved is going out, or is lower than what you think \"0\" ought to be. For instance, if I measure potential energy from the top of Mt. Everest, we all have negative potential energy. (Unless you are reading this on top of Everest or higher... in which case, I guess you do have positive potential energy.) Energy levels of electrons in atoms are usually assigned negative energy levels. \"Negative Energy\" weapons won\\'t do anything unusual compared to your negative mass projectile.\\n']},\n",

       "  'answer': [\"\\nYes, position of middleware functions in express needs to be proper.\\nMiddleware functions in express work between a client's request and response. Every middleware function has access to request, response and its following middleware function. Middleware functions are executed in the order specified and skip error handling functions until it is invoked.\\napp.use(middleware1);\\napp.use(middleware2);\\napp.use(middleware3);\\n\\nIn the above example, middleware1 will be executed first and it invokes middleware2 by using,\\nnext();\\n\\n\\nSay middleware2 is an error handler method with a next function. middleware3 will not be executed unless an error occurred. Because error handling methods are executed only when it is invoked.\\nSay middleware2 is an error handler method without a next function. middleware3 will not be executed at all.\\n\\nso, error handling function must be at the middleware stack's last (also at the last of route handling methods).\\n\"]}}"
